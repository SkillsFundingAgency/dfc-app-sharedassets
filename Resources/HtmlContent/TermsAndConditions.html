Purpose of documentThis “Terms of use” document is produced as a guidance to help users and organisations understand their obligations and responsibilities in integrating with the Education Skills and Funding Agency (ESFA) National Careers Service Job Profiles API. Please note following about this “Terms of use” document:•  These “Terms of use” are only applicable to Job profiles API service and in no shape or form be taken to represent other National Careers Service provided directly and indirectly to an induvial or institution.•  These “Terms of use” does not supersede in anyway the current terms and conditions ESFA and / or National Careers service might have with other government / non-government organisations unless explicitly stated herein. •  These “Terms of use” remains permanently in effect until a revised document is supplied and signed-off2.  IntroductionJob profile API is a RESTful API that provides a simple and consistent approach to requesting job profile data. Currently the API only supports summary of all job profiles and details of a single profile only.The current version of the API is v1 and requires registration to access specification and authorisation key to access data, we have rate limits in place, these are explained further in this document. The API does not support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). It is therefore not possible to call our APIs from client-side code within a web browser, for example using Ajax.3.  StakeholdersThe following Service Provider(s) and Consumer(s) will be used as the basis of “Terms of use:Service Provider: Education Skills and Funding Agency (“ESFA”) and National Careers ServiceApplication Developer: An individual or entity making use of Job profiles API and data (“the Developers”)End User: any member of the general public or an institution, accessing information through the API portal (“the Users”)4.  Getting started4.1.  Register for a developer accountYou will need to register both on our test system (OAT) as well as on the Production (live) system when you are ready to go live.4.2.  RegistrationPlease note that only one designated account will have access to the testing portal and the ability to generate subscription keys. To gain access follow these steps.4.2.1.  Testing (OAT) environment 1.  Go to https://oat-portal.api.nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/ and sign-up for an account.2.  You will receive a verification email within 24 hours of signing up. After this time if the email still has not been received (at the registered email account) then please contact the National Careers Service team at api.jobprofiles@education.gov.uk 3.  After verification of email address, a confirmation email will be sent to out suggesting registration is complete, and users should then be able to access API specification after successful login to the portal.Upon email verification you will also be automatically assigned an API key. N.B - API key will be used as authorisation to access data from the API and must be sent with every request. See section 3.4, “API key authorisation” for further details.4.2.2.  Production (Live)Before registering for the production environment, you will have to be registered on our testing (OAT) environment and have successfully completed testing against the same. The registration process for Production (live) is detailed below: 1.  Go to (Production API URL https://portal.api.nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/) and sign-up for an account.2.  You will receive a verification email within 24 hours of registration. After this time if the email still has not been received (at the registered email account) then please contact the National Careers Service team at api.jobprofiles@education.gov.uk3.  After verification of email address, a confirmation email will be sent out, to confirm that user account has been set up providing users access to the Production portal following successful login. N.B – at this point users will still not able to access / view live Job Profiles data until they have followed steps 4 and 5 and subsequently been authenticated by National Careers Service team. 4.  Once you have signed up for the API interface (portal), you need to email following details to api.jobprofiles@education.gov.uk, in order to gain access via a subscription key. This key is used as authorisation to access data from the API and must be sent with every request. •  name of the person registered,•  organisation,•  role,•  registered email address,•  a contact telephone number in case we need further details.5.  Upon successful receipt of above information, you will receive a confirmation email within 5 working days, confirming that you have been granted API key / token to access data. If your organisation has not received any correspondence during this time, then please contact the National Careers Service team at api.jobprofiles@education.gov.ukN.B - API key will be used as authorisation to access data from the API and must be sent with every request.4.3.  API Specification•  Testing (OAT) environment: automatic registration lets users access sample Job Profiles data by registering on https://oat-portal.api.nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/ . Please refer to registration section (3.2.1) of this document for details to get access to OAT Job Profiles sample data.•  Production (Live): 2 staged process, where users sign up to the Production portal and submit their and organisation details which are then authenticated by National Careers Service team. Please refer to registration section (3.2.2) of this document for details to get access to Production Job Profiles sample data.4.4.  API key authorisationThe job profiles API requires an API key, to be sent with each request. The API key should be sent as a header `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` on every request.To obtain an API key, please go through registration process (as specified in section 3.2) and after you gain access to developer portal, scroll to subscription section and where you can view your primary and secondary keys, you will also have an option to re-generate keys.5.  VersionJob profiles API is versioned, and the current version of the API is v1.Version header must be included on every request, an incorrect value would result in 'Not found (404)'We only support 1 previous version. When a new version is released, we expect API users to move to the new version and to help with transition, we will support the previous version for period of up to 3 months.Please note: 1.  New version will only be created when there is a breaking change to the API specification (e.g. schema change), any fixes and updates that does not change the specification will be applied to the same version.2.  Only the latest version will have updated job profile data during the transition period, job profile data in previous version will not receive any content or data updates.N.B - With the above in mind, in the likelihood of an issue, incident or a bug, we reserve the right to change or update the API (including any breaking changes) with immediate effect. Should there be such an instance, we shall endeavour to notify all API users about the change as soon as possible. 6.  Rate limitWe limit the number of requests each application can make. This protects our service against excessive use and Denial-of-Service attacks and also encourages efficient use of our APIs.We set limits based on anticipated loads and peaks. Our standard limit is 150 requests per minute per application.Our rate limit works on an approximate rolling minute basis - we count the number of requests made in the last 60 seconds, not the last discrete minute.If you reach this limit, you’ll get a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).If you continually hit this rate limit, contact us to discuss your application design and whether it’s appropriate to raise your rate limit.7.  SecurityThe API can only be accessed over TLS 1.2.It is important to keep your API keys secure, to prevent them being discovered, your account being compromised, and your rate-limit quota being exceeded. There are a few best practices that can help with this:a)  Do not embed API keys in your codeStoring keys in your application code increases the risk that they will be discovered, particularly if any of your source code is made public or can be viewed by people who should not have access to the key. Instead, you should consider storing them inside environment variables or configuration.b)  Do not store API keys in your source treeIf you store API keys in files, perhaps inside a configuration or environment file, these should not be stored inside the application source tree, just in case part or all of the source is made public or can be viewed by people who should not have access to the key.c)  Restrict API key use by IP address and domainLimiting the use of a key to a specific IP address or domain will reduce the usefulness of a key that becomes compromised.d)  Regenerate your API keysBy regenerating your API keys regularly, and certainly with each application release, you can lessen the chance that a key will be discovered.8.  TestingYour organisation is responsible for the testing, implementation, monitoring, support, maintenance and changing integration in line with consumption of the Job Profiles data within the National Careers Service8.1.  Operation acceptance testingPlease see section 3.2.1 “Testing (OAT) environment” of this document for further details.8.2.  Integration testingYou should test using our OAT environment before using the production API. To encourage use of the production environment, the OAT environment contains full and real data for only a selected number of Job Profiles (the remaining Job Profiles in OAT contain dummy but representative data). The production environment contains full and real data for all Job Profiles that are live on the National Careers Service website.8.3.  Performance testing•  You must inform us before carrying out any performance testing.•  All performance testing must be conducted within the OAT environment. You must not conduct any performance testing within the live production environment.8.4.  Security testingYou must exclude the API from any security testing, as this could falsely trigger our security alerts.9.  Fault toleranceWhen you use any API, keep in mind that errors and exceptions (e.g. server connection problems or outages) are rare, but they happen. To make sure that your integration is as reliable as it can be, you should always watch for errors and exceptions and use circuit breaker pattern to implement your API integration.If an API call returns an error, log the call in as much detail as you can, including what you sent along with the entire error response and headers. If you need to contact us, this information can speed up the help process.10.  Conditions of useThese terms of use explain what you can expect from us and what we expect from you when creating and operating software services that consume National Careers Service Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) hosted on the National Careers Service Developer portal. They do not create a legal relationship between National Careers Service and any software developer. Conditions of use for Job Profiles API data include (but not limited to): •  Use of Job Profiles data 'must not' create a bias or seem to be giving preference to certain groups and / or any organisation•  The usage of the data supplied within the API is covered by Open Government License v3.0 We reserve the right to remove your access to the Developer and Production (Live) portal and its APIs temporarily or permanently.These terms may change from time to time and we will let you know when this happens. For major changes you may need to re-accept these terms of use, but for minor changes we will assume you agree to the changes unless we hear from you.These “Terms of use” remain valid until superseded by a revised document.For any queries or basic support, email api.jobprofiles@education.gov.uk11.  Changes to the APIWe endeavour to give you at least 2 months’ advance notice of any changes that may affect integration and consumption of the API.12.  Service AvailabilityNational Careers Service will make reasonable efforts to provide continuous operation of the Service, except for any scheduled maintenance work or whilst making any necessary changes to the API. We cannot guarantee any percentage or hours of uptime available during these times.13.  What we expect from you13.1.  AcknowledgementWhere the use of the API Job Profile data, either in part or in full, then you must acknowledge National Careers Service as the source of the information with a  link to https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/13.2.  Information sources•  You must add the following link to identify the source https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/ along with National Careers Service logo.•  Skills data within the National Careers Service Job Profile have been supplied by ONet Occupational Data System. This includes the data fields 'ONetAttributeType', 'ONetRank' and 'ONetElementID'. The data within these fields cannot be amended in any way.A reference citation referring to the skill data source of the 'ONet Occupational Data System should be included within any presentation of the ONet Skill data.13.3.  Acceptable useYou must ensure that the National Careers Service Job Profile API data is only used in the context of Careers information, advice and guidance.14.  Data CachingJob Profile data is updated regularly by the National Careers Service. As a result, you should also regularly refresh your own Job Profile data obtained via the relevant API data feed. Where you use local caching of Job Profile API data, then you should ensure that your Job Profile data is refreshed at least every 3 months.15.  Reporting Website AnalyticsWe may ask for website analytics and usage measures of some or all of your web pages that consume Job Profile API data from the National Careers Service, either on an ad-hoc or regular basis. These web analytics may include 'number of visitors', ‘page views’ etc.
